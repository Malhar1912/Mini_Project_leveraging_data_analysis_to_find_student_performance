# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes student performance based on study hours and scores using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to explore data relationships and visualize trends to gain meaningful insights.

## Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** – Data handling  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Data visualization  

## Dataset  
**File:** `student_scores.csv`  
**Columns:**  
- `Hours` → Number of study hours  
- `Scores` → Student performance scores  

## Visualizations  
### 1️⃣ Box Plot: Distribution of Scores  
- Helps identify outliers and overall score distribution.  

### 2️⃣ Scatter Plot: Study Hours vs. Scores  
- Shows correlation between study time and performance.  

## How to Run  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
   ```  
2. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```  

## Key Insights  
✔ More study hours generally lead to higher scores.  
✔ Outliers in student scores suggest inconsistent performance.  
✔ Data visualization helps in identifying meaningful trends.  

## Future Improvements  
🔹 Add linear regression for predictive modeling  
🔹 Use additional student-related factors for deeper analysis
